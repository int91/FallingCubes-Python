# Falling Cubes - Python
A very basic version of Falling Cubes Lua Edition, written in python using pygame.

This version of Falling Cubes has an entity class system in which all entity types inherit the base entity class. Enemies spawn, fall towards the player, and the player simply tries to dodge or kill the enemies.
